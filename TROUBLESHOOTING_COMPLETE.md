# 🔍 HowToCook MCP Server - Complete Troubleshooting Report

## ✅ Investigation Summary

**GOOD NEWS**: The HowToCook MCP server is working perfectly! The issue was **documentation inconsistency**, not a technical problem.

### 🧪 Test Results

I conducted comprehensive testing and confirmed:

- ✅ **NPM Package**: Version 1.0.4 published successfully
- ✅ **MCP Server**: Responds correctly to JSON-RPC requests
- ✅ **All 5 Tools**: Working and returning proper recipe data
- ✅ **No Console Output**: Server runs silently as required for MCP
- ✅ **Binary Configuration**: Both `cook-mcp-windy` and `cook-mcp-server` binaries are correctly configured

### 🐛 Root Cause: Documentation Confusion

The main issue was that the README.md showed **outdated configuration**:

❌ **Wrong (Old README)**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "howtocook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["cook-mcp-windy", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

✅ **Correct Configuration**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "howtocook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["cook-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Use the Correct Configuration

### Step 1: Update Claude Desktop Configuration

Replace your Claude Desktop MCP configuration with:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "howtocook": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["cook-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Configuration File Location

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop completely.

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### Test 1: Verify Package Installation
```bash
npx cook-mcp-windy info
```
Should show available tools and features.

### Test 2: Test MCP Server Binary
```bash
npx cook-mcp-server
```
Should start silently (no output) and wait for JSON-RPC input.

### Test 3: Test in Claude Desktop
Ask Claude: "帮我推荐一个4人份的中式晚餐搭配"

## 📋 Available MCP Tools

Once configured correctly, Claude will have access to:

1. **`get_all_recipes`** - Retrieve all recipes with pagination
2. **`get_recipes_by_category`** - Filter by category (水产, 早餐, 荤菜, etc.)
3. **`get_recipe_details`** - Get detailed recipe information with scaling
4. **`recommend_meal_plan`** - Generate intelligent weekly meal plans
5. **`recommend_dish_combination`** - Suggest balanced dish combinations

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Package Structure
- **Package Name**: `cook-mcp-windy`
- **Version**: 1.0.4 (latest)
- **Binaries**: 
  - `cook-mcp-windy` (CLI tools)
  - `cook-mcp-server` (Direct MCP server)

### How It Works
```
Claude Desktop → npx cook-mcp-server → Direct MCP Server (no CLI wrapper)
```

The `cook-mcp-server` binary:
- Starts immediately without console output
- Communicates via JSON-RPC over stdio
- Provides all 5 recipe management tools

- "麻婆豆腐怎么做？给我调整到6人份"

### Meal Planning

### Special Dietary Needs
